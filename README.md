# Tic-Tac-Toe #

This app is a classic tic-tac-toe game. A grid made up of nine squares and when the user clicks it increments a counter to count turns and also check the next user's symbol and change the background. This functionality will check if the numberTurn is divisble by 2. If not the next click will show X. If it is then O. Once the counter gets to over 9 nine turns, the game will end. Each turn will check to see if somebody won or if both users tied.
